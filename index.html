					Dutch periodical founded by THEO VAN DOESBURG in 1917 and published in Leiden until 1932; the name was also applied from the 1920s to a distinctive movement and to the group of artists associated with it. The periodical’s subtitle, Maandblad voor de beeldende vakken (Monthly Journal of the Expressive Professions), indicates the range of artists to which it was appealing, and van Doesburg’s intention was that it be a platform for all those who were concerned with a new art: painters, sculptors, architects, urban planners, typographers, interior designers, and decoratve artists, musicians, poets, and dramatists. The search for a nieuwe beelding (new imagery) was characterized by the elementary components of the primary colours, flat, rectangular areas and only straight, horizontal, and vertical lines. Former ideals of beauty had to be relinquished in favour of a new consciousness to represent the spirit of the times.

					It has been assumed that the periodical’s name De stijl was taken from the writings of the German architect Gottfried Semper, which were drawn upon frequently by H. P. Berlage and others. It must also be said, however, that from 1910 many young artists had argued that a new style had to be found. The term nieuwe beelding was frequently used at this time. Van Doesburg considered that the MODERNE KUNSTKRING led by Conrad Kickert (1882–1965) in 1910 was the early stage of international modernism in the Netherlands, and De stijl was founded to continue this tendency. Before World War I works of Expressionism, Cubism, and Futurism, the newest tendencies in Germany, France, and Italy respectively, had been exhibited in the Netherlands; De stijl was established in deliberate contrast with these movements. Although most of those involved with De stijl felt a connection with Cubism, they also believed that the movement had become obscured by more fashionable aesthetic principles, and that its original tenets could be realized through De stijl and its associated movement.

					The periodical’s first three years (1917–20) were fundamentally distinct from the subsequent years. These first 36 issues had a standard format (245×185 mm or 260×195 mm), and most were printed on grey–white paper, sometimes with a green or grey cover. The motif on the cover was taken from a woodcut by VILMOS HUSZÁR. Illustrations were scarce: occasionally a colour illustration was provided as a separate insert; advertisements were carried only on the inside of the cover pages. The exact print run is not known but is estimated at several hundred. With few exceptions, each issue was in Dutch, and circulation was virtually exclusively in the Netherlands; the Italian periodical Valori plastici made reference to it only in 1919. The contents included editorials by van Doesburg, who was also frequently the author of polemical articles. Many contributions were by architects, including J. J. P. OUD, JAN WILS, GERRIT RIETVELD, and ROBERT VAN ’T HOFF, the last-named being responsible for the periodical’s financing. PIET MONDRIAN was, however, responsible for around 70% of the contents of these early issues. His series on ‘De nieuwe beelding in de schilderkunst’ was followed by one on ‘Natuurlijke en abstracte realiteit’. De stijl gave Mondrian the opportunity to publish the aesthetic theories that he had attempted to articulate from 1909; the later impression that he and De stijl were synonymous results from his huge contribution to these early issues.

					Georges Vantongerloo: Interrelation of Volumes, sandstone, 137×225×137 mm, 1919 (London,…Probably influenced by Futurism, van Doesburg discovered the manifesto as a means of succinct dissemination of his ideas and those of his associates. The first of these appeared in the first issue of 1918 as a call to all those who wished to launch a new art and culture to unite. It was published in Dutch, French, German, and English and was signed by van Doesburg, Mondrian, Huszár, Georges Vantongerloo (see fig.), van ’t Hoff, Wils, and the poet Antony Kok. The second manifesto, published in April 1920 in Dutch, French, and German, focused on ‘word painting’, and it was signed by Kok, van Doesburg, and Mondrian; van Doesburg was the most outspoken representative of the new ‘visual’ poetry, and in the next issue he published his first poems under the pseudonym I. K. Bonset.
